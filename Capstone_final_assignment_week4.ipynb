After transforming the data to Json files, it is easy to use Pandas to transform them into DataFrame. Then select the required data columns to appear and get the information we want. Geopy library is used to get the latitude and longitude values. With the locations the maps can be created and we will have a direct understanding of the neighborhoods and the purposed areas. The Folium library is also used to show maps on different requirements.\n",
